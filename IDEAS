IDEA DUMP

* "steal" ideas from other sites
** this one seems pretty good! http://www.chessgames.com/perl/fischerandom
** this one too! http://www.chessvariants.com/diffsetup.dir/fischerh.html

* norepeat (uses localstorage)
** shows X/960
** allows retrieval of date used + notepad
** allow well-formatted date + note download and upload ("download and upload bc localstorage")

* make it online so that u can add these features:
** every setup is in theory "balanced", however not every setup is in theory "fun".  allow people to rank layouts e.g 5/960 5/5 (riveting setup), 127/960 1/5 (boring setup)
